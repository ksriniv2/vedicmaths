Vedic Maths is ancient system of mathematics formulated over many centruies by sages of India.

Sanskrit is the language in which all the explanations and functions are defined.

To memorize the functions much easier, it has been written as simple suthras.

These methods are performance efficient and simplify the maths.

These library is being written to showcase the maths to newer generation. 

Every method has information about suthras and what it means and how its devised.

Hope it helps the developers and wider community is welcome to improve on it.
